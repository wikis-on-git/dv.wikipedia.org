The '''International Phonetic Alphabet''' ('''IPA''') is a system of [[phonetic transcription|phonetic notation]] devised by linguists to accurately and uniquely represent each of the wide variety of sounds ([[phone]]s or [[phoneme]]s) used in spoken human language. It is intended as a notational standard for the [[Phoneme|phonemic]] and  [[Phonetics|phonetic]] representation of all spoken languages.

For a treatment of the [[English language]] using the IPA, see [[International Phonetic Alphabet for English]]; for a brief chart, see [[IPA chart for English]].
