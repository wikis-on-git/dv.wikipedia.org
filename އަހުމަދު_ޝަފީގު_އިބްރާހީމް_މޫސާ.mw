'''Ahmed Shafeeq Ibrahim Moosa''' ([[Dhivehi]]: &#1927;&#1958;&#1920;&#1968;&#1929;&#1958;&#1931;&#1962; &#1949;&#1958;&#1930;&#1961;&#1934;&#1968; &#1927;&#1960;&#1924;&#1968;&#1923;&#1959;&#1920;&#1960;&#1929;&#1968; &#1929;&#1963;&#1936;&#1959;) ('''b.''' [[November 4]], [[1968]]),  commonly known as '''Ahmed Moosa'''  or  ''sappé'', is a member of the [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]'s general council. He is a  widely  outspoken critic of the current Maldivian [[government]] and the president [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]]. Moosa is currently living in self-proclaimed [[exile]] in the [[United Kingdom]] with his family.


==Early and personal life==
Moosa was born in [[Malé]], [[Maldives]]. He married to Miranda Moosa in [[1993]], with whom  he had three sons. In [[2002]] they had a [[divorce]].  Later that year he married Fathimath Moosa, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Before his political career began, Moosa filled several government and private company posts.  He also managed and ran his own businesses. In March 1999 he founded ''A'' Company Private  Limited. This company was mainly involved in consultancy work in engineering, web design,  printing & publishing, composition of business and marketing proposals and reports and many  more.

==Educational background==
Moosa completed his secondarys education at [[Malé English School]], [[Malé]]. In [[1990]] he  acquired General Certificate of Education grade A, from  [[Asmai Secondary School]],  [[Kuwait]]. On [[July 13]], [[1995]] he graduated from [[University of Glasgow]] with Bachelor  of Engineering with Honours in Mechanical Engineering. Two years later, in [[1997]], he  graduated at [[University of Birmingham]] acquiring Master of Philosophy (Engineering) in  Metallurgy and Materials.

==Political career==
In [[september 19]], [[2003]], [[Evan Naseem]] who was serving at [[Maafushi]] jail was severely  beaten up and ultimately paid with his life; end result of a series of complicated disputes  between inmates. News broke out the following day and there was a [[2003 Maldives civil unrest|civil unrest in the capital  city]] of the [[Maldives]], [[Malé]]. International media, namely [[BBC]], covered this unusual  event. Moosa gave an interview to BBC on the following month and left Maldives, on [[October 15]], [[2003]], to [[United Kingdom]]. The interview,  however, was aired on [[October 17]], [[2003]]. He claims that he left the country because he  believes he would be in danger if remained in Maldives. "I have already left the country  fearing the worst" said sappé in a written statement published on his website.

He joined [[Maldivian Democratic Party]] on [[November 10]], [[2003]], soon after its  official announcement and currently is a member of its general council. However, he does not  get involved with day to day operations of the party for two reasons. That is; MDP's major  operations are carried out in [[Sri Lanka]] and he operates his own website DhivehiObserver,  which is his major line of connection with the Maldivian public.

After his initial interview to [[BBC]] ([[October 2003]]), he gave several other interviews on  different occasions. They appeared to have exerted pressure on Maldivian government and were  usually responded.
